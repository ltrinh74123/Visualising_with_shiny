# Visualising_with_shiny

When the project started, I was responsible for presenting the results in a user-friendly and comprehendible way. We discussed the potential results we could collect from applying different forecasting models on time-series data. While I helped write the code from ARMA-GARCH, I was mainly in charge of compiling and sorting the produce in order to make an interactive dashboard using Shiny in R. For not having played with shiny before and having to learn about the UI and server side, I'm pretty proud of how it turned out. 

Things to focus on in the future:
  -  Decrease the input box
  -  Fit the 2 line graphs side by side for better comparison.
  -  Advance: Add another input option to insert a csv that will be modelled into more results
